- Made the mistake of using double quotes rather than single quotes for strings
- Thought it was weird that we could only pass in variables into an `if` statement

- Didn't like that they couldn't put a conditional directly into an `if` statement
- Would have liked to see an `else if` statement but was able to circumvent using nested `if` and `else` statements
- Overall liked the language
